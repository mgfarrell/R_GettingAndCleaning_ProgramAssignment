# Getting And Cleaning - Program Assignment

This read me file provides an overview of the run_analysis.R script that was developed to process, clean, and summarize the data per the assignment instructions, along with a brief code book which provides a high level overview of the observations and variables.  The code book is not intended to provide the level of detail that would typically be included in a data dictionary, rather it describes the variables that were selected, renaming of variables, and aggregation of the data set.
